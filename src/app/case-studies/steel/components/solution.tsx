                                <strong>Steel Works Seattle</strong> faced a major identity crisis. They had two completely different customer profiles:
                            </p>
                            <ul className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
                                <li>
                                    Homeowners & Architects: Seeking artisanal, aesthetic products like custom gates, railings, and stairs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    General Contractors & Developers: Needing a reliable, large-scale structural steel fabrication partner for commercial and industrial projects.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Their old website failed to speak to either group. It mixed messages, making large contractors feel SWS was too small (&quot;they just make gates&quot;), while homeowners found SWS too &quot;industrial&quot; and intimidating. Their brand felt fractured, and their website was failing as a business tool.

                                    First, we solved their messaging problem. We developed a core brand strategy around the concept of &quot;Masterful Steel at Every Scale.&quot; This new identity celebrated their dual expertise, positioning them as a single, sophisticated firm that could handle both intricate custom work and large-scale commercial structures with equal precision.
                                </p>

                                        From the homepage, users are immediately guided to two clear paths: <strong>&quot;Custom Metalwork&quot;</strong> (for B2C) or <strong>&quot;Commercial Services&quot;</strong> (for B2B).
