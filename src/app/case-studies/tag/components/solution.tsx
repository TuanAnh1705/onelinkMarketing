                                We built their complete e-commerce foundation on the Shopify 2.0 platform. This was broken into three key streams:

                                    <strong>Technical SEO & Performance:</strong> To ensure the new site was visible from day one, we implemented a complete technical SEO strategy. This included configuring the HTTPS & SSL certificate, optimizing all meta titles and descriptions, and enforcing a clean H1-H2 header structure. We ensured all URLs were search-friendly before submitting the final sitemap to Google Search Console. Critically, we engineered advanced page speed optimization, implementing image compression and lazy loading to achieve sub-second load times.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Frictionless UX Design:</strong> We conducted a full UX/UI Design process, building all key site pages from scratch: the homepage, product listing pages (with filters), product detail pages, and a streamlined shopping cart and checkout. We applied Tag&apos;s brand identity, color palette, and typography consistently across all templates and implemented subtle animations and hover states to enhance user engagement. This was all validated through rigorous Responsive Design & Testing, including specific Touch-Friendly Optimization for all buttons and navigation.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Full E-commerce Website Setup:</strong> To bring the design to life, we handled the complete site setup. This involved inputting all website copy and media, uploading the full product catalog with all variants and descriptions, and integrating their chosen payment gateways. We configured the Shopify CMS admin panel for easy product and order management and integrated their entire lead capture and tracking stack, including Google Analytics 4, Meta Pixel, and TikTok Pixel.

                                To maximize their ad spend right at launch, we designed a suite of high-impact <strong>Landing Pages.</strong> Each page featured a custom layout, <strong>custom UI elements, and micro-interactions</strong> to guide the user flow. We integrated crucial <strong>functionality & tracking</strong> for each campaign, including chat plugins and lead capture forms, ensuring every new visitor was tracked and converted efficiently.
